I am a postdoctoral research in Jessica I.W. Morgan's Retinal Imaging Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine. My research interests include imaging structure/function relationships in the human retina. Currently, I am investigating the aggregate and single-cone photoreceptor function in a normative population.
